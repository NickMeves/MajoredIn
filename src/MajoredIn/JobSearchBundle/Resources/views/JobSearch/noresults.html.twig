<p>Is everything spelled correctly? You're probably a good speller, but it doesn't hurt to make sure.</p>
<p>Did you go a little overboard with the advanced filters? Try removing a few of those if you have too many.</p>
<p>If you're willing to commute a bit farther, try expanding your search radius by increasing the distance filter.</p>
<p>Our servers might've screwed things up too; nothing you can do about that one.</p>
